# Alarconpy: A Python Package for Meteorologists

Alarconpy is a tools collection in Python programming language that offers many functions and algorithms for several meteorological applications as well as for a quickly processing of weather data. It includes, among other, functions for calculating some atmospheric variables such as saturation vapor pressure and relative humidity, units converting, maps creation, predefined color palettes for plotting meteorological variables and some tropical cyclones applications such as radial wind profiles.
It also contains in a same function the facilities of other Python packages benefiting existing and future users.

# Alarconpy requirements

Alarconpy is developed for Python 3.x and there are some python libraries required for use it:

- Numpy: It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things: a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated functions and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. The NumPy array object is the common interface for working with typed arrays of data across a wide-variety of scientific Python packages. NumPy also features a C-API, which enables interfacing existing Fortran/C/C++ libraries with Python and NumPy (https://www.scipy.org).

- Metpy: It is a modern meteorological open-source toolkit for Python. It is a maintained project of Unidata  to serve the academic meteorological community. MetPy consists of three major areas of functionality: Plots, Calculations and File Input/Output (https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/index.html)

- Cartopy: It is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing in order to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses. It makes use of the powerful PROJ.4, NumPy and Shapely libraries and includes a programmatic interface built on top of Matplotlib for the creation of publication quality maps.

- Scipy: It is one of the core packages that make up the SciPy stack. It provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines, such as routines for numerical integration, interpolation, optimization, linear algebra, and statistics.

- NetCDF4: It is the Python interface to the netCDF C library. This module can read and write files in both the new netCDF 4 and the old netCDF 3 format, and can create files that are readable by HDF5 clients (https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/netCDF4/index.html).

- Matplotlib: It is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy  (https://matplotlib.org). Also, it is a sophisticated library capable of producing publication-quality graphics in a variety of formats, and with full LaTeX support.

- Time: This module provides various time-related functions (https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html.
